# README

The Meditation App allows you to add meditations to your calendar. By seeing how much you've accomplished, you'll stay motivated to keep your practice going. You can also explore and discover new meditations.

This app uses a Rails backend as an API and AngularJS front end

## Just Git it!

Put a fork in it, copy it, and clone it. Open in your text editor of choice.

## Bundle it up

If you don't have bundler installed, run 'gem install bundler' in your terminal, then 'bundle install' to install gem dependencies.

## Off the Rails

In your terminal, run 'rails db:migrate' to create the database and schema.
Run 'rails db:seed' to seed your database with meditation information and icons.

## Bower (Not the one from 24)

Run 'bower install --save' in your terminal to download Angular dependencies.

## Start her on up

Run rails server in your terminal and head over to http://localhost:3000/#!/ in your browser

Create a user and get your butt on a cushion. Add the type of meditation, how long you meditated, and the date to your calendar. Namaste
